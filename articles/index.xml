      <description>In a previous job interview, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked a basic question about OOP: &amp;ldquo;What are the four pillars of OOP?&amp;ldquo;. It made me feel really bad about not being able to give an answer because I use these concepts everyday.
The interview had also reminded me of how frustrating it felt to not understand the concept during my time in college. Those books where they tell you that a cat is an object didn&amp;rsquo;t help at all.</description>

      <title>A Close Look at Golang&#39;s defer</title>
      <link>https://pdiway.com/articles/a-close-look-at-golang-defer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never come across anything like Go&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; in any of the languages I&amp;rsquo;ve
worked on before. As far as I know there isn&amp;rsquo;t an equivalent
of it in PHP and the closest we have in Java is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29788307/what-is-the-defer-equivalent-for-java&#34;&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been coding in Go you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used the
&lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; statement plenty of times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
