<p>In a previous job interview, I&rsquo;ve been asked a basic question about OOP: &ldquo;What are
the four pillars of OOP?&ldquo;. It made me feel really bad about not being able to
give an answer because I use these concepts everyday.</p>

<p>The interview had also reminded me of how frustrating it felt to not understand
the concept during my time in college. Those books where they tell you that a
cat is an object didn&rsquo;t help at all. Using cats and dogs as objects does not
make it easier for a someone struggling to get a gist of what an object is.</p>

<p>I figure it&rsquo;s time for a refresher.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re builing software, I&rsquo;ll be using real world examples.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-object">What is an object?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend we&rsquo;re working for a e-commerce company and we&rsquo;ve been asked to
work on processing the payments.</p>

<p>In this system we could have a <strong>CreditCard</strong> object. We could also have an
<strong>Invoice</strong> object. Some other objects we could add are <strong>SalesOrder</strong> or
<strong>Product</strong>.</p>

<p>An object is a representation of real-world objects inside our system.
Although, they&rsquo;re not limited to items in the real-world (e.g. data
structures).</p>

<h2 id="class-vs-object">Class vs Object</h2>

<p>Hopefully you now get the gist of what an object is. But what is a class and
how does it differ from an object?</p>

<p>To put it simply: a class describes the object. Still confused? In the next
section we&rsquo;ll describe  a <strong>Credit Card</strong>:</p>

<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

<p>What makes a Credit Card?  You can&rsquo;t have a credit card without a
<strong>credit card number</strong>, <strong>expiry date</strong>, a <strong>cvv</strong>, and the <strong>card owner&rsquo;s name</strong>.
These make our class&rsquo; properties.</p>

<pre><code>class CreditCard {
    public String cardNumber;
    public String expiryDate;
    public String cvv;
    public String ownerName;
}
</code></pre>

<p><sub><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: For the sake of simplicity the properties here are public.
This is a code smell and you should avoid exposing your class properties.</sub></p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>

<p>What can we do with a credit card? We can <strong>charge</strong> the card or <strong>save</strong> it for
later.  These are the methods. A method is something we can do to an object.
Usually methods names are actions.</p>

<pre><code>class CreditCard {
    public String cardNumber;
    public String expiryDate;
    public String cvv;
    public String ownerName;

    public void charge(Integer amount) {
        ...
    }

    public void save() {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do we need to do this? It&rsquo;s too complicated for itty-bitty pieces of data.
Why not just have variables for the <code>creditCardNumber</code>, <code>cvv</code>, <code>expiryDate</code>, and <code>ownerName</code>.
<sub>-Imaginary guy who has just learned to code.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is we need to pass this data around the system and passing those 4
variables from one function to another could lead to mistakes. Oh, and what if you were dealing with more than 4 variables, say an <em>Invoice</em>.</p>

<p>Also, <em>when</em> (not if) the spec  changes you&rsquo;d have to look all over for those variables.</p>

<p>A class wraps all those variables for you which makes life a little bit easier.
In the OOP world this is called <strong>encapsulation</strong> which I would like to talk about some more in a separate post about the four pillars of OOP.</p>
