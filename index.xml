      <description>My name is Paul Daniel Iway from the Philippines. I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing web applications with PHP for about 5 years now and Im starting to write command line applications with Go recently.
Not only can I write applications, I can also help ensure smooth delivery to production environments by implementing a good delivery pipeline. I use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
Tech stack Languages: Go, PHP, JavaScript</description>

      <description>At work we have a Digital Ocean droplet serving some Wordpress sites. These had no Floating IPs which means if for some reason we needed to destroy the droplet and restore from a snapshot theres a large chance we would end up losing the IP address.
So I got approval from the higher-ups to start adding the Floating IP and update the DNS record of one of the sites.</description>

      <title>Struggling with OOP</title>
      <link>https://pdiway.com/articles/basic-oop/</link>

      <description>In a previous job interview, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked a basic question about OOP: &amp;ldquo;What are the four pillars of OOP?&amp;ldquo;. It made me feel really bad about not being able to give an answer because I use these concepts everyday.
The interview had also reminded me of how frustrating it felt to not understand the concept during my time in college. Those books where they tell you that a cat is an object didn&amp;rsquo;t help at all.</description>

      <title>A Close Look at Golang&#39;s defer</title>
      <link>https://pdiway.com/articles/a-close-look-at-golang-defer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never come across anything like Go&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; in any of the languages I&amp;rsquo;ve
worked on before. As far as I know there isn&amp;rsquo;t an equivalent
of it in PHP and the closest we have in Java is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29788307/what-is-the-defer-equivalent-for-java&#34;&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been coding in Go you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used the
&lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; statement plenty of times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
